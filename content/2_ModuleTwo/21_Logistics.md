## Accessing QwikLabs & AWS environment

For Fortinet Cloud Workshops, you will use [**QwikLabs**](https://fortinet.qwiklabs.com/paths) to provide a pre-staged AWS account with the workshop environment deployed for you.

Once logged in, click **Explore** at the top of the page and look for **FortiGate: Protecting AWS Resources**, then click the green **Start Lab** button to begin.

This environment will run for 90 minutes and then automatically clean up and shutdown all resources.  If you restart the lab, then you will start with a clean environment where you will start with task1 again.

**Once the environment has finished provisioning, on the left of the QwikLabs Console you will see the link to open the AWS console and other information to log into the AWS console and FortiOS primary instance.**

## Navigating the AWS Console

When you first login you will see the Console Home page.

Use the **Search Box** at the top to search for services such as EC2, VPC, etc.

When the results pop up, **right click** the name of the service and open the desired console in a new tab. This makes navigation easier.
